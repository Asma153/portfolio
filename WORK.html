<p>After graduating in History from Peterhouse, Cambridge, Lawrence worked in the City before setting-up his own speech writing business. His approach rests on a simple assumption: when we feel under pressure, our desire to come across as 'professional' leads us to speak and write in unappealing, often boring, ways. Lawrence is passionate about redressing this. 
    He founded 'Great Speech Witing and Communication', a boutique business providing communications support for individuals and businesses around the world. He writes for Heads of State, politicians, CEOs and leaders in sport, fundraising, and business as well as private individuals looking to shine at social events and dinners. For many years  he has specialised in writing TEDx and TED talks to help great people transfer their brilliant ideas into memorable, inspirational speeches.   . This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
